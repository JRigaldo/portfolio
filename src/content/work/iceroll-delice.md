### What is Iceroll Délice ?

> A creative concept

Iceroll Délice is an artisanal ice cream show. It's an innovative ice cream creation concept. Indeed, chefs clad in mock and kitchen aprons are busy creating ice creams using a frozen plate that frosts the ingredients placed on it. The ice creams are made from fresh fruits and cream. When the consumer chooses their flavor, the chef grabs the ingredients to create the ice cream. They place them on the plate and chop them with two spatulas. Then, they add cream, which they mix with the mixture and spread out. The ice cream forms instantly. Using their spatulas, the chef scrapes the surface of the plate to form ice cream rolls, which they place in a container to give to the amazed spectator.
