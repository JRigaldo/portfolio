## IDMobile website

> Design, integration into Symfony from scratch

As a web developer at ID Mobile, I had the opportunity to design and implement a complete marketing website to promote the company's products. My main role was to synthesize all their products and services into different web pages, with a focus on optimal user experience.

### Designs and Interfaces

To accomplish this, I devoted a lot of time to designing user interfaces, ensuring they were visually appealing and user-friendly. I also seamlessly integrated these designs into the website, ensuring that each page was consistent with the brand and easy to navigate.

### PHP, Twig, Gsap

One technical aspect of this project was the use of Symfony 5 framework for the website development. Symfony enabled me to effectively structure the code and ensure the robustness and security of the application.

Additionally, I utilized Gsap to animate certain elements of the site, thereby adding a dynamic and engaging dimension to the user experience. These animations helped make the site more appealing and capture visitors' attention right from their arrival.
